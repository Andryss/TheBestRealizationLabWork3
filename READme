List of changes:
1) BIGGGG changes in Country:
    * it's not enum
    * added inner static class CountryFactory (Code for initialization from Main copypasted there)
    * since CountryInitializationException extends Exception now, added some try-catches blocks in CountryFactory
2) added countries validation in World (if population of Country > MAX_POPULATION initializer returns null)
3) Main looks a lot prettier now))
4) Changes in puml, of course (check the inner class representation in puml maybe it should be changed)
5) Overwrite some Object methods in all classes (toString by hand, other auto-generated in general)

IDEAS
1) Maybe we should check in World if countries.length > 1 and if true print only one message with WORLD results for all counties in summary
and else print results for 1 country (because output looks too huge even with 3 countries)
