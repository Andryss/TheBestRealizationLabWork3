List of changes:
1) Turns out that abstract class ChoosingPublisher isn't necessary at all (Look inside Publish class)
2) Each non abstract Publisher now includes 2 methods: printResult and invokePersonMethod
3) changes in puml
4) TODO: add interface (Maybe publishable and create some local class with only 2 methods in it)
