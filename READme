List of changes:
1) add inner enum PublishOption in Publisher
  (publish method use PublishOption now)

2) move some help-help methods in abstract class Publisher (from it's children)
  (so there is less code now)

3) change initialization and initializationRandom in CountryFactory
  (it is bad if factory initialize only one variant, so I move creating in main again)

4) CountryInitializationException is Runtime now

5) delete Country-validation from World and make it Singletone
  (so there is only one World now)
