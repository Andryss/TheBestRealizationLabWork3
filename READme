List of changes
1) added class Country
2) class Publisher is no longer abstract
3) too many fields in class Book, maybe we should reduce their amount
4) big changes in class ReadingWorld which is World now
The main point of this class is to store countries in one place
and invoke their methods.
Also we should be able to get some results, so we need to actually store them somewhere.
5) Some ideas:
* But I cant think about something but hashmap, which I dont really want to use.
* Maybe we should make method read in Readable void-type, and create some counter inside
 each Book which will be increased in read
* There also is some strange idea: to make some books more interesting for people depending on the current year in the world
